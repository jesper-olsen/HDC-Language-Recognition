HDC-rs
==============

Rust version of the language recognition algorithm in the Py/Matlab/Verilog directories above.
Uses binary rather than bi-polar vectors [4].

Run
-----

```
% cd HDC-Language-Recognition/Rs
% cargo run --release
```

Benchmark
---------

Below we will benchmark the time it takes to train and test a model.
There are 21 test languages (1k sentences per language) and 22 training languages (21+afr, 10k sentences each). All times are in seconds (wall clock) on a Macbook Air M1 (2020, 8 cores). 

Number of bits is rounded up to fill a whole even number of usize elements.

```
% time cargo run --release
```
